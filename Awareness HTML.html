        <h2>Understanding the Impact</h2>
        <p><strong>Climate change</strong> is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. It refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities are currently driving an unprecedented rate of change.</p>

        <p>Rising greenhouse gas emissions, particularly <em>carbon dioxide</em> and <em>methane</em>, have led to global warming, which is causing glaciers to melt, sea levels to rise, and extreme weather events to become more frequent.</p>
